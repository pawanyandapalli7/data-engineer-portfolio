## 👋 About Me

I am a Data Engineer with 4+ years of experience designing and building scalable, cloud-native data platforms. I specialize in Python, SQL, and PySpark, with hands-on experience across batch and CDC pipelines, data modeling, and analytics enablement.

My background includes building production data systems on AWS for healthcare and insurance datasets, where data quality, security, and compliance are critical. I focus on creating reliable, performant pipelines that transform raw data into trusted, analytics- and ML-ready datasets.
